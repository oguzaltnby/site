### üîß Getting Started

You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to your machine. Node.js comes with its own package manager called `npm`, you can either use that or you can use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation) since it's faster and caches downloaded dependencies properly.

- Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/oguzaltnby/blog`
- Install dependencies with your preffered package manager.
  - With pnpm: `pnpm install`
  - With NPM: `npm install`
- If you are going to use Firebase, you'll need to rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the config.
  - **P.S.** You can use the website without the Fireabse integration as it requires a bunch of additional steps on its own. Read the title below for more information.
- Start the app:
  - For development:
    - With pnpm: `pnpm dev`
    - With NPM: `npm run dev`
  - To build and compile:
    - With pnpm: `pnpm generate` (or `pnpm build`)
    - With NPM: `npm run generate` or (`npm run build`)

If you are wondering about **how to host it on free/paid static hosting services** like (Netlify, Vercel etc.), you can refer to [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org/deployments/netlify/). My project is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
